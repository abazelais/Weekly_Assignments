        Should we use non-standard additions in HTML? I feel that you should not
        be using non-standard additions especially if you are working on a huge
        group project. I donâ€™t think that it is ethical and that it would be
        accepted amongst the group. The other developers apart of the project will
        probably not be comfortable and it is not a normal concept in HTML. I
        think that sticking to the standard formatting would be the best practice.
        Also, if non-standards are used it could affect the accessibility of a
        site for those who may need further assistance while browsing the web.
        Maybe if you were to create a site that you were working on by yourself,
        that could be acceptable. It would allow you to experiment on your own and
        see how your page may respond.

        With browsers moving away from Flash, and HTML5 allows for more
        compatibility among other platforms especially mobile devices. A lot more
        people use their phones or tablets now since they are on the go instead of
        being in front of a computer or laptop all the time. I think that it may
        be more secure than Adobe Flash because you may not get as much malware
        with HTML5. The loading time of a page may be less with HTML5 versus using
        something with Flash.
